We will represent all agent state in the form of messages, so it needs to be able to work well with them.It should work with the OpenAI function calling interface. This means it should either be an OpenAI model or a model that exposes a similar interface.Note: these model requirements are not requirements for using LangGraph - they are just requirements for this one example.from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI# We will set streaming=True so that we can stream tokens# See the streaming section for more information on this.model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, streaming=True)After we've done this, we should make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call.\nWe can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for OpenAI function calling, and then bind them to the model class.from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_functionfunctions = [format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]model = model.bind_functions(functions)Define the agent state\u200bThe main type of graph in langgraph is the StatefulGraph.\nThis graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node.\nEach node then returns operations to update that state.\nThese operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.\nWhether to set or add is denoted by annotating the state object you construct the graph with.For this example, the state we will track will just be a list of messages.\nWe want each node to just add messages to that list.\nTherefore, we will use a TypedDict with one key (messages) and annotate it so that the messages attribute is always added to.from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequenceimport operatorfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessageclass AgentState(TypedDict):    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]Define the nodes\u200bWe now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.\nIn langgraph, a node can be either a function or a runnable.\nThere are two main nodes we need for this:The agent: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.A function to invoke tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.We will also need to define some edges.\nSome of these edges may be conditional.\nThe reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.\nThe path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).Conditional Edge: after the agent is called, we should either:a. If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be calledb. If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finishNormal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do nextLet's define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take.from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolInvocationimport jsonfrom langchain_core.messages import FunctionMessage# Define the function that determines whether to continue or notdef should_continue(state):    messages = state['messages']    last_message = messages[-1]    # If there is no function call, then we finish    if \"function_call\" not in last_message.additional_kwargs:        return \"end\"    # Otherwise if there is, we continue    else:        return \"continue\"# Define the function that calls the modeldef call_model(state):    messages = state['messages']    response = model.invoke(messages)    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list    return {\"messages\": [response]}# Define the function to execute toolsdef call_tool(state):    messages = state['messages']    # Based on the continue condition    # we know the last message involves a function call    last_message = messages[-1]    # We construct an ToolInvocation from the function_call    action = ToolInvocation(        tool=last_message.additional_kwargs[\"function_call\"][\"name\"],        tool_input=json.loads(last_message.additional_kwargs[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"]),    )    # We call the tool_executor and get back a response    response = tool_executor.invoke(action)    # We use the response to create a FunctionMessage    function_message = FunctionMessage(content=str(response), name=action.tool)    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list    return {\"messages\": [function_message]}Define the graph\u200bWe can now put it all together and define the graph!from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END# Define a new graphworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)# Define the two nodes we will cycle betweenworkflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)workflow.add_node(\"action\", call_tool)# Set the entrypoint as `agent`# This means that this node is the first one calledworkflow.set_entry_point(\"agent\")# We now add a conditional edgeworkflow.add_conditional_edges(    # First, we define the start node.

This is useful when you want to have a human review the current state before proceeding to a particular node.\nFor a walkthrough on how to do that, see this documentationPlanning Agent Examples\u200bThe following notebooks implement agent architectures prototypical of the \"plan-and-execute\" style, where an LLM planner decomposes a user request into a program, an executor executes the program, and an LLM synthesizes a response (and/or dynamically replans) based on the program outputs.Plan-and-execute: a simple agent with a planner that generates a multi-step task list, an executor that invokes the tools in the plan, and a replanner that responds or generates an updated plan. Based on the Plan-and-solve paper by Wang, et. al.Reasoning without Observation: planner generates a task list whose observations are saved as variables. Variables can be used in subsequent tasks to reduce the need for further re-planning. Based on the ReWOO paper by Xu, et. al.LLMCompiler: planner generates a DAG of tasks with variable responses. Tasks are streamed and executed eagerly to minimize tool execution runtime. Based on the paper by Kim, et. al.Reflection / Self-Critique\u200bWhen output quality is a major concern, it's common to incorporate some combination of self-critique or reflection and external validation to refine your system's outputs. The following examples demonstrate research that implement this type of design.Basic Reflection: add a simple \"reflect\" step in your graph to prompt your system to revise its outputs.Reflexion: critique missing and superflous aspects of the agent's response to guide subsequent steps. Based on Reflexion, by Shinn, et. al.Language Agent Tree Search: execute multiple agents in parallel, using reflection and environmental rewards to drive a Monte Carlo Tree Search.

One way to do this is with simulations.Chat bot evaluation as multi-agent simulation: how to simulate a dialogue between a \"virtual user\" and your chat botMultimodal Examples\u200bWebVoyager: vision-enabled web browsing agent that uses Set-of-marks prompting to navigate a web browser and execute tasksDocumentation\u200bThere are only a few new APIs to use.StateGraph\u200bThe main entrypoint is StateGraph.from langgraph.graph import StateGraphThis class is responsible for constructing the graph.\nIt exposes an interface inspired by NetworkX.\nThis graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node.__init__\u200b    def __init__(self, schema: Type[Any]) -> None:When constructing the graph, you need to pass in a schema for a state.\nEach node then returns operations to update that state.\nThese operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.\nWhether to set or add is denoted by annotating the state object you construct the graph with.The recommended way to specify the schema is with a typed dictionary: from typing import TypedDictYou can then annotate the different attributes using from typing imoport Annotated.\nCurrently, the only supported annotation is import operator; operator.add.\nThis annotation will make it so that any node that returns this attribute ADDS that new result to the existing value.Let's take a look at an example:from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Unionfrom langchain_core.agents import AgentAction, AgentFinishimport operatorclass AgentState(TypedDict):   # The input string   input: str   # The outcome of a given call to the agent   # Needs `None` as a valid type, since this is what this will start as   agent_outcome: Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish, None]   # List of actions and corresponding observations   # Here we annotate this with `operator.add` to indicate that operations to   # this state should be ADDED to the existing values (not overwrite it)   intermediate_steps: Annotated[list[tuple[AgentAction, str]], operator.add]We can then use this like:# Initialize the StateGraph with this stategraph = StateGraph(AgentState)# Create nodes and edges...# Compile the graphapp = graph.compile()# The inputs should be a dictionary, because the state is a TypedDictinputs = {   # Let's assume this the input   \"input\": \"hi\"   # Let's assume agent_outcome is set by the graph as some point   # It doesn't need to be provided, and it will be None by default   # Let's assume `intermediate_steps` is built up over time by the graph   # It doesn't need to provided, and it will be empty list by default   # The reason `intermediate_steps` is an empty list and not `None` is because   # it's annotated with `operator.add`}.add_node\u200b    def add_node(self, key: str, action: RunnableLike) -> None:This method adds a node to the graph.\nIt takes two arguments:key: A string representing the name of the node. This must be unique.action: The action to take when this node is called. This should either be a function or a runnable..add_edge\u200b    def add_edge(self, start_key: str, end_key: str) -> None:Creates an edge from one node to the next.\nThis means that output of the first node will be passed to the next node.\nIt takes two arguments.start_key: A string representing the name of the start node. This key must have already been registered in the graph.end_key: A string representing the name of the end node. This key must have already been registered in the graph..add_conditional_edges\u200b    def add_conditional_edges(        self,        start_key: str,        condition: Callable[..., str],        conditional_edge_mapping: Dict[str, str],    ) -> None:This method adds conditional edges.\nWhat this means is that only one of the downstream edges will be taken, and which one that is depends on the results of the start node.\nThis takes three arguments:start_key: A string representing the name of the start node. This key must have already been registered in the graph.condition: A function to call to decide what to do next. The input will be the output of the start node. It should return a string that is present in conditional_edge_mapping and represents the edge to take.conditional_edge_mapping: A mapping of string to string. The keys should be strings that may be returned by condition. The values should be the downstream node to call if that condition is returned..set_entry_point\u200b    def set_entry_point(self, key: str) -> None:The entrypoint to the graph.\nThis is the node that is first called.\nIt only takes one argument:key: The name of the node that should be called first..set_finish_point\u200b    def set_finish_point(self, key: str) -> None:This is the exit point of the graph.\nWhen this node is called, the results will be the final result from the graph.\nIt only has one argument:key: The name of the node that, when called, will return the results of calling it as the final outputNote: This does not need to be called if at any point you previously created an edge (conditional or normal) to ENDGraph\u200bfrom langgraph.graph import Graphgraph = Graph()This has the same interface as StateGraph with the exception that it doesn't update a state object over time, and rather relies on passing around the full state from each step.\nThis means that whatever is returned from one node is the input to the next as is.END\u200bfrom langgraph.graph import ENDThis is a special node representing the end of the graph.\nThis means that anything passed to this node will be the final output of the graph.\nIt can be used in two places:As the end_key in add_edgeAs a value in conditional_edge_mapping as passed to add_conditional_edgesPrebuilt Examples\u200bThere are also a few methods we've added to make it easy to use common, prebuilt graphs and components.ToolExecutor\u200bfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolExecutorThis is a simple helper class to help with calling tools.\nIt is parameterized by a list of tools:tools = [...]tool_executor = ToolExecutor(tools)It then exposes a runnable interface.\nIt can be used to call tools: you can pass in an AgentAction and it will look up the relevant tool and call it with the appropriate input.chat_agent_executor.create_function_calling_executor\u200bfrom langgraph.prebuilt import chat_agent_executorThis is a helper function for creating a graph that works with a chat model that utilizes function calling.\nCan be created by passing in a model and a list of tools.\nThe model must be one that supports OpenAI function calling.from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResultsfrom langgraph.prebuilt import chat_agent_executorfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessagetools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]model = ChatOpenAI()app = chat_agent_executor.create_function_calling_executor(model, tools)inputs = {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"what is the weather in sf\")]}for s in app.stream(inputs):    print(list(s.values())[0])    print(\"----\")create_agent_executor\u200bfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_agent_executorThis is a helper function for creating a graph that works with LangChain Agents.\nCan be created by passing in an agent and a list of tools.from langgraph.prebuilt import create_agent_executorfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain import hubfrom langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agentfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResultstools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!prompt = hub.pull(\"hwchase17/openai-functions-agent\")# Choose the LLM that will drive the agentllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\")# Construct the OpenAI Functions agentagent_runnable = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)app = create_agent_executor(agent_runnable, tools)inputs = {\"input\": \"what is the weather in sf\", \"chat_history\": []}for s in app.stream(inputs):    print(list(s.values())[0])    print(\"----\")PreviousLangSmith WalkthroughOverviewInstallationQuick StartSet up the toolsSet up the modelDefine the agent stateDefine the nodesDefine the graphUse it!StreamingStreaming Node OutputStreaming LLM TokensWhen to UseExamplesChatAgentExecutor: with function callingAgentExecutorAsyncStreaming TokensPersistenceHuman-in-the-loopPlanning Agent ExamplesReflection / Self-CritiqueMulti-agent ExamplesChatbot Evaluation via SimulationMultimodal ExamplesDocumentationStateGraphGraphENDPrebuilt ExamplesToolExecutorchat_agent_executor.create_function_calling_executorcreate_agent_executorCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright \u00a9 2024 LangChain, Inc.\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/", "title": "\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd78\ufe0fLangGraph | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 Langchain", "description": "\u26a1 Building language agents as graphs \u26a1", "language": "en"}}}]
